# Instructions to Setup JavaFX

1. You must have Java installed first.
2. Download the JavaFX SDK for your operating system from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ (the one that says SDK, not mods)
3. The downloaded file should be a .zip file. Extract its contents to a location on your hard-drive. Remember where you put it. A good suggestion to make the later steps easier it to place the JavaFX folder somewhere near the root of your hard drive (e.g., C:\javafx on Windows or /Users/yourname/javafx on Mac). Also, do not include any spaces in the folder names.
4. Go to https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/ and select JavaFX and IntelliJ from the menu. Follow the 5 steps for creating a "Non-modular from IDE" project. Wherever these steps refer to /path/to/javafx-sdk-13, enter the path to the directory where you extracted the files to in the previous step (e.g., C:\javafx on Windows or /Users/yourname/javafx on Mac). Ensure you follow the directions precisely.

# Make sure to:
If all goes well, you should be able to run the Main.java file that was created in the project template and get a blank window. You will also need to perform the "Add VM Options" step for each JavaFX application you want to execute.

# Electronic Store using JavaFX

This was an assignment for COMP1406 [Computer Science II] and uses a graphical user interface to attach to an electronic store model with an understanding of the Model/View/Controller paradigm, the goal was to maintain a separation between the GUI and the underlying electronic store model with a continuation of applying the principles of OOP, such as encapsulation.
